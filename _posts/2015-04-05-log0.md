登陆时遇到了验证码，目前觉得可以在这里多花一点时间，顺手点一点CV技能。
目前的想法是，调用验证码脚本请求到目标图片和待选择图片，然后进行识别。
可行性源于图片较简单，都是数字。
模型倾向于生成模型这样的，比如朴素贝叶斯，计算P(crawled image features | assume it is number 0<=i<=9)。

目前模型已训练好，程序在[github](https://github.com/y26jin)上。下一步就是要调用js脚本模拟整套行为了。。。

There are many ways to bypass simple captcha code verification but I decided to spend some time on the pattern recognition method.

It is not necessarily the easiest way but it is a good opportunity for me to learn new stuff.

Current thoughts:

Retrieve target image and choice images and throw them in a number recognition model. The model is generative model.

Naive Bayes model is an ideal one by calculating P(crawled image features | assume it is number 0<=i<=9).

Number recognition model source code is available on [github](https://github.com/y26jin).
